# Term project for EE522 Digital Signal Processing
## Pre-processing raw EEG data

This project involves using information about common noise in EEG recordings to filter raw recordings for detecting events in the delta wave frequency spectrum.

* To see code and output figures in context, open design.ipynb
* The final report and presentation slides are found in the IEEE report directory.
