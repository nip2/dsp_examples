    "Systems for which the output $y[n]$ satisfies the $N$th order linear constant-coefficient difference equation of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_k y[n-k] = \\sum_{m=0}^{M} b_m x[n-m]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    y[n] &= \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{n} x[k] \\\\\n",
    "         &= x[n] + y[n-1]\n",
    "\\end{align*}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* As shown by example, representation of LTI systems is not unqiue\n",
    "* Practical considerations may determine the best representation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uniqueness\n",
    "Linear constant-coefficient difference equation does not uniquely determine the output\n",
    "\n",
    "$y[n] = y_p[n] + y_h[n]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_h[n]$ is any solution such that for $x[n]=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_k y_h[n-k] = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Called the __homogenous difference equation__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_h[n] = \\sum_{m=1}^{N} A_m z_m^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the coefficients $A_m$ are chosen to satisfy a set of auxiliary conditions. The complex numbers $z_m$ are the roots of the polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "$A(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N} a_k z^{-k}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of $N$ auxiliary conditions are required to uniquely specify $y[n]$\n",
    "* Often specified in the form of $y[-1], y[-2], \\dots, y[-N]$\n",

    "$y[n] = -\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{a_k}{a_0} y[n-k] + \\sum_{k=0}^{M} \\frac{b_k}{a_0} x[n-k]$\n",

    "\n",
    "then the solution $y[n]$ is unique\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary conditions are often stated as __initial-rest__. This means that if $x[n]=0$ for all $n<n_0$ then $y[n]=0$ for $n<n_0$ for some $n_0$. Sufficient to determine $y[n]$ for $n\\geq n_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship to LTI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* All LCCD equations at initial rest are LTI systems\n",
    "* Not all LTI systems can be represented as LCCD\n",
    "* However, most of the systems that we create (design), can be represented as LCCD systems\n",

    "### FIR Systems\n",
    "If $N=0$, then $y[n]$ is not a recursive equation and no auxiliary conditions are needed\n",
